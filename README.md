# TC Brewery Project
## Located at https://thadstin.github.io/ThadStin.github.io-/tc_brewery_project/

A responsive, simple and specific, yet informative, website that will locate only microbreweries by city name.
Search by city name ONLY and a maximum of 20 results will be returned in a pop-up modal that the 
user can scroll through to retreive name, url, phone, street address, city/state, and brewery
type (just to confirm it is a micro brewery :) ).

TC Brewery Project utilizes the OPEN BREWERY DB api to populate data for the user to search.
It has very clear documentation and is easy to utilize.  There are several parameters you can set 
for your query.  If you are interested in using it, you can find it here: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/

## Limitations of TC Brewery project:

1. User cannot search by state, therefore returning results for same town name in different states.
  i.e. If user searches for 'Portland', will get results for both 'Portland, Maine' AND 'Portland, Oregon'.
2. The returned url is not click-able.  The user must copy and paste in to address bar.
3. The phone number is not click-able or hashed for easy reading.
4. Close modal button will not stick at top of modal when scrolling on mobile or tablet.

## Why?

This project was made to easily and simply find different microbreweries in the town which you specify.
So many other sites return results for brewpubs, distributors, and other locations that sell other's beer
and cider.  I enjoy drinking craft beer and getting to know the people that make it.  Now I can enjoy being 
able to find those places easily without having to sort through local bars.
